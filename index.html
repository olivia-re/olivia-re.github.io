    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>I am a Computer Science student at Towson University, currently in my junior year. I am finally going back to school after
        taking five years off from my degree. I live in Baltimore City and work as a waitress at a popular brunch spot when I'm not in school.
        Balancing work and school full time is difficult, but I am excited to see where this degree will take me in the future! </p>
